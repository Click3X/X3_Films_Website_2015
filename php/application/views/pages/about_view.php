							<div class="bottom-line"></div>
							<p class="excerpt">Megan's career has encompassed both production company and agency. A creative problem-solver, Megan's rich and varied production experiences have covered almost every conceivable combination of creative and budget. Following a period as Head of Production at Czar and The Sweet Shop, Megan parlayed her expertise in shooting abroad by starting Runaway International. She then spent a few years on the agency side, where she gained a whole new perspective on the business producing both digital content and broadcast spots. From there Megan headed up live action at Shilo before moving back to her international production roots in launching Savage in the US. For the past two years, Megan has been the Executive Producer / Managing Director of Click 3X Live Action. She has cultivated a roster of more than a dozen top flight directors, working on global advertising campaigns with some of the world's most recognizable brands.</p>
